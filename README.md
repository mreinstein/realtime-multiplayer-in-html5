Forked Copy
=============================

The original repository this is from is essentially frozen. It includes reference material for an article on game networking, so the author is understandably reluctant to change it. 

Here's what my changes do:
* switches `game.core.js` from object oriented to a data oriented approach
* uses es modules everywhere
* moves number functions to not extend the built in number type
